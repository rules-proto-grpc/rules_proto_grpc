## Announcements ðŸ“£

#### 2025/06/19 - Version 5.3.0

[Version 5.3.0 has been released](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/releases/tag/5.3.0),
which adds support for JavaScript.

#### 2025/06/06 - Version 5.2.0

[Version 5.2.0 has been released](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/releases/tag/5.2.0),
which adds support for Scala and Swift languages, updates dependency versions and fixes more bugs. Note
that using Swift support requires that you use an unreleased version of `rules_swift_package_manager` at
present.


#### 2025/05/16 - Version 5.1.0

[Version 5.1.0 has been released](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/releases/tag/5.1.0),
which updates underlying dependency versions and fixes a few key bugs. Note that C language support
has also been dropped, as the Î¼pb API used was considered unstable and the plugin is no longer
available outside of the `protobuf` workspace.

#### 2024/07/31 - Version 5.0.0

[Version 5.0.0 has been released](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/releases/tag/5.0.0),
which rewrites the rules to support Bzlmod only. Moving to Bzlmod provides a huge improvement in the
stability and maintainability of these rules, as third-party transitive dependency management has
been handed off to Bazel and new versions of gRPC and Protobuf should hopefully be able to be
supported more rapidly.

At present not all languages supported by the 4.x.x
are supported by this release, with support for the remaining languages being tracked
[here](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/issues/299). For these unsupported
languages - or for WORKSPACE repos - it is recommended you continue using the 4.x.x releases.

The way you use these rules is largely unchanged, but unfortunately the paths used for load of the
rules will have changed due to the splitting into language-specific modules. Please see
[the docs](https://rules-proto-grpc.com/en/latest/) for details of how to migrate your usage to
these new rules, in particular the
[release notes](https://rules-proto-grpc.com/en/latest/changelog.html).
